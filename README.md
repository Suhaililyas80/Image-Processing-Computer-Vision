# Image-Processing-Computer-Vision

## Objective
Develop a ML model for image enhancing,processing and segmentation to solve real world problems

## Approach
Explored techniques like sampling, quantization,image enhancement, edge detection, & image
segmentation Utilize these techniques to manipulate, analyze, and extract meaningful information from images.
Devloped ML model that could classify,segment images based on their respective categories using image segmentation.


## Outcome
Built a ML model for image segmentation achieving optimum accuracy on a large dataset containing images of
different categories. Attained accurate results in image enhancement, edge detection, and segmentation
